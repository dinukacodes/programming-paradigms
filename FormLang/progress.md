# FormLang++ Project Progress

## Milestone 1: Grammar Definition and Basic Lexer ✅

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created directory structure (src, examples, tests, output, docs)
   - Set up initial source files (lexer.l, parser.y, formLang.h)

2. **Lexer Implementation**
   - Implemented token definitions for:
     - Keywords: form, section, field, text, email, password, required, optional
     - Identifiers and literals
     - Symbols: {, }, :, ;, ,
   - Added error handling with line numbers
   - Implemented debug output for token recognition

3. **Testing**
   - Created example form (registration.form)
   - Implemented test script (test.sh)
   - Successfully tested lexer with example form
   - Verified token recognition and error handling

### Current Status:
- Lexer successfully recognizes all tokens in the FormLang++ grammar
- Basic error handling implemented
- Ready for integration with parser in Milestone 2

## Milestone 2: Basic Parser Structure ✅

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Parser Implementation**
   - Implemented basic parser with support for:
     - Form declarations
     - Section declarations
     - Field declarations with types
     - Field attributes (required/optional)
   - Added semantic checks for field declarations
   - Implemented AST construction during parsing

2. **AST Structure**
   - Defined node types for forms, sections, and fields
   - Implemented memory management for AST nodes
   - Added debug output for AST construction

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added line number tracking for error messages
   - Implemented error recovery for common syntax errors
   - Added validation for field declarations

4. **Testing**
   - Successfully tested parser with registration form
   - Verified error handling with invalid form syntax
   - Confirmed proper AST construction

### Current Status:
- Parser successfully handles all basic form structures
- AST construction working correctly
- Error handling and recovery implemented
- Ready for HTML generation in Milestone 3

### Next Steps:
- Implement HTML generator (Milestone 3)
- Add support for validation rules
- Implement client-side validation
